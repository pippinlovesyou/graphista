# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at
[conduct@graphrouter.org].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
